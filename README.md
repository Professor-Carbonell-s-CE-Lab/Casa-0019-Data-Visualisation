### Professor-Carbonells-Lab
BimOps Co2 &amp; Temperature Monitoring
# 💫 Read Me:

Hello, this  project focuses on enhancing environmental awareness through Augmented Reality (AR) through a Digital Twin and a physical device, specifically targeting CO2  and temperature in the context of the CE-Lab and one Pool Street. Our project features an animated AR character, designed to bridge the gap between environmental data and user-friendly and educational interaction.

Key Features
Virtual CE-Lab: A digital twin of a physical lab environment, created using Blender, enriched with realistic textures and lighting to mirror actual conditions.
Data Visualization: Real-time data visualization of environmental metrics like CO2 levels and temperature in an interactive AR dashboard.
A Physical devicee that displays temperature reading of One Pool Street, created by 3D and UV printing.

User Interaction: Engaging user interface in Unity that allows users to interact with "Professor Carbonell" for an immersive educational experience.

Technologies Used

Blender: For 3D modeling and creating the virtual lab environment.
Unity: To integrate AR elements and manage user interactions.
Fusion 360: For designing the physical prototype of the monitoring device.
Arduino: Employed for collecting and processing real-time environmental data.
