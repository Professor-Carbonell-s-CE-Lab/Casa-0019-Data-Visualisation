### Professor-Carbonells-Lab
BimOps Co2 &amp; Temperature Monitoring
# üí´ Read Me:

Hello, this  project focuses on enhancing environmental awareness through Augmented Reality (AR) through a Digital Twin and a physical device, specifically targeting CO2  and temperature in the context of the CE-Lab and one Pool Street. Our project features an animated AR character, designed to bridge the gap between environmental data and user-friendly and educational interaction.

Key Features
Virtual CE-Lab: A digital twin of a physical lab environment, created using Blender, enriched with realistic textures and lighting to mirror actual conditions.
Data Visualization: Real-time data visualization of environmental metrics like CO2 levels and temperature in an interactive AR dashboard.
A Physical devicee that displays temperature reading of One Pool Street, created by 3D and UV printing. The room allow to change by press the two buttons.

User Interaction: Engaging user interface in Unity that allows users to interact with "Professor Carbonell" for an immersive educational experience.

Technologies Used

Blender: For 3D modeling and creating the virtual lab environment.
Unity: To integrate AR elements and manage user interactions.
Fusion 360: For designing the physical prototype of the monitoring device.
Arduino: Employed for collecting and processing real-time environmental data.
Getting Started

To explore our project, please follow the instructions provided in the Installation Guide. This will guide you through setting up the project environment on your local machine.
